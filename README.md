# Welcome to my solution!

Before testing the tast I would like to share some insingts of what I've done and why I chose certain approach.
I tried of being creative rather than completely replicate the example. All the requirments were met.

## Front-end framework

Due to the scope of the task I choce to proceed this task with **Vue.js** framework which allows to develop the solution efficiently.

## Things to clear

The example online had only three steps. In order to have four steps that are mandatory I decided to split personal details into two parts. This the reason why Co-applicants have their own tab.  
In order to fulfill requirments to have **one question at the time** I used multiple validation libraries instead of writing my own validators.

# Installation

**What's used**:

- Vue.js
- FontAwesome
- Sass
